      <description>What Is This? This is Neva or Nevalang (these two names are interchangeable) - an open-source flow-based general-purpose programming language with static typing and a focus on visual programming, which compiles into machine code and Go.&#xA;Why Yet Another Language? As clich√© and unbelievable as it sounds, Nevalang has no direct analogs. Its combination of characteristics makes it a unique language, well-suited for addressing two issues in programming where significant progress has not been felt for many years - visual programming and implicit parallelism.</description>

      <description>Install Nevalang and create your first project in one minute!&#xA;Installing Nevalang To begin, download the Nevalang installation script using the following command:&#xA;curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.sh | bash If everything is ok you should be able to execute&#xA;neva version And see output like this (version could differ):&#xA;0.8.0 Creating Your First Project Let&amp;rsquo;s create a new project named test. Execute the following commands to set up your project:&#xA;neva new test This command will create test directory with neva.</description>

      <title>Style Guide</title>
      <link>https://nevalang.org/docs/style-guide/</link>

      <description>The Nevalang style guide outlined in this document sets the standards for organizing and formatting code, designing components, and choosing appropriate names. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that all programs follow this guide to ensure consistency across Nevalang code, making it easier to read and understand.&#xA;Code Organization Lines Count: Aim for files to be up to 300 lines. Files longer than 300 lines should be split, indicating a need for better organization. Formatting Short Lines: Keep lines under 80 characters to enhance readability, accommodate split-screen setups, and avoid horizontal scrolling, especially for those who prefer large text for eye care.</description>

      <title>Compiler directives</title>

      <description>Compiler directives are special instructions for compiler.&#xA;They are not intended to be used on a daily basis by regular user but good nevalang programmer understands how they work because they are base for how many language features operate.&#xA;#extern Directive for component that tells the compiler that given component does not have implementation in source code and instead a runtime function call must be created.&#xA;#bind Directive for node that tells the compiler to insert given message to corresponding runtime function call.</description>

      <title>FAQ</title>

      <description>Welcome to the FAQ page! Here, we&amp;rsquo;ve compiled all the questions that you might not find answers to on other documentation pages. This section was primarily created as a reference for ourselves - when developing something as complex as a programming language, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget the reasons behind certain decisions. So, we thought, why not document at least those related to the language&amp;rsquo;s external aspects, right here on the website!</description>

      <description>Build Build is set of Nevalang modules. Every module has unique module reference. One of the modules is entry module.&#xA;Module Module is a set of packages. Every module has its own manifest file.&#xA;Entry Module Entry is a root module for compilation algorithm. Every entry module must have executable package.&#xA;Module Reference Entity that refers to a module via path and version.&#xA;Module Manifest File that describes which version of language this package supports and list of its dependencies.</description>
