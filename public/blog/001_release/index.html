<p>After three years of hard work in private, I&rsquo;m happy to say that Nevalang is ready for everyone to see!</p>
<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey</h2>
<p>Since starting in <a href="https://github.com/nevalang/neva/commit/9c7c7b7c28caa6b632e674afb0a517ced875689">June 2021</a>, I&rsquo;ve often worried if I could finish this project. I wondered if my idea would ever be ready to show to the world. Solving each problem was like fighting a monster that grows back its heads - as soon as I solved one thing, new problems appeared. Numerous times, just as I sensed the solution was within reach, I&rsquo;d hit a dead end, realizing with horror that the only way forward was to backtrack several steps and start anew in a different direction.</p>
<p>It felt like the work would never end. Sometimes, I even asked myself if I was crazy for spending so much of my free time on it, with only a few friends knowing about my project.</p>
<p>These three years have taught me a lot. I could have become a successful tech blogger if I weren&rsquo;t so lazy - I encountered problems ranging from developing my own type system to integrating WebAssembly code into an Electron application. The biggest thing I learned is that I should have shared my language earlier.</p>
<h3 id="three-years-in-silence">Three Years In Silence</h3>
<p>Instead of showing a simple version early on to get feedback and help, I worked alone for three years, like having a second full-time job.</p>
<p>This happened for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t have much experience managing projects.</li>
<li>I ran into many unexpected challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the first point is straightforward (I&rsquo;m glad to say lessons were learned), the second is worth talking about more.</p>
<p>Creating Nevalang wasn&rsquo;t just about crafting another programming language; it was about reimagining programming itself. Integrating concepts like FBP with static typing and visual programming were monumental tasks.</p>
<p>At first, you think the type system can do without generics&hellip; How naive. Then you try to decide if you really need to bring everything from FBP - maybe drop array ports or at least sub-streams? Nope, that won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-references">Lack Of References</h3>
<p>I found it hard to find references. There are visual languages out there, but they are usually very specialized: Scratch, LabVIEW, Unreal Blueprints, Node-RED, Blocky, Ballerina, DRAKON, you name it.</p>
<p>The same goes for dataflow languages. There are some general purpose things like NoFlo, but they aren&rsquo;t statically typed, which is a big deal. I also looked for an FBP language that didn&rsquo;t require using a traditional language like JavaScript, but FBP itself doesn&rsquo;t limit you to that, making it hard to find examples.</p>
<p>Essentially, the unique combination of features in Nevalang makes it both unique and challenging to develop because there aren&rsquo;t many references.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>While I made the mistake of not releasing sooner, over these years, Nevalang has matured with a distinct identity. The core components, such as the compiler, runtime, and type system, have been solidified, outlining a clear path forward for both the language and its ecosystem.</p>
<p>I could have invested another year to release the language in its perfect form, but it&rsquo;s now clear to me that would have been misguided. There&rsquo;s a considerable amount of work still ahead, and new horizons await us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a minimal community and start gathering feedback.</li>
<li>Begin speaking at conferences and writing posts to promote Nevalang&rsquo;s ideas.</li>
<li>Write the most necessary modules of the standard library.</li>
<li>Work on Go interop - in and out.</li>
<li>Revive and bring the visual editor in VSCode to a minimally viable state.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am thrilled to share this moment with you. Let&rsquo;s together watch as Nevalang takes its first baby steps and help it along the way!</p>
