Welcome to the Nevalang documentation! Here, you'll find everything you need to get started with the language, from the very basics to more advanced concepts.

Please note that Nevalang is in its early stages of development, and many things may not work correctly or may change rapidly. If you encounter any issues or discrepancies between the documentation and reality, please create an issue on GitHub or make a Pull Request with corrections.

Happy coding!
