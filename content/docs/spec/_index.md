This is the Language Specification section. It consists of a collection of documents, each detailing a specific part of the language. 

In the "Source Code" section, you will find descriptions of high-level abstractions that users interact with. These are the inputs for the compiler.

The "Type-System" section provides an in-depth explanation of how the type-system works. This is arguably the most complex part of a compiler's analyzer. It details the different types available and the rules they adhere to.

Lastly, the "Runtime" section provides insights into how a Nevalang program is executed under the hood. This section is crucial for understanding the operational aspects of the language.
